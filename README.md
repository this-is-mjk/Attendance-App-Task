### what i learned for this project

1. got my weekness of react, like cookies and a bit of await, known and will now work on it
2. got to know i can ignore the CORS issue of localhost by using localh.st
3. came to know about Flask and DeepFace technologies
4. helped me to brush me up with a few mongo db resources and python
5. came to know about pip freeze > requirements.txt to list all requirements easily.
6. http://localh.st:5000 for CORS issue solution.

### Area of Improvement in backend

1. to make the code more readable by using file organising for different function
2. JWT implementation intergration with the frontend.
3. front end is very messy with a lot of code repetation, would like to organise the same and learn new concept to use multiple useStae variables across the react app without passing every where,
4. React code can get full of errors in no time, i want to make it organised and compact so that it is esay to use at multiple places, modularity is my focus.

### Scope of improvement in frontend

1. increase the readablity
2. organise the files and fucntions in a better way.
3. understand the concepts of useEffect, hooks, ects in deep, currently i face a bit issue in this topic
4. Reduce copy pasting, increase typing you myself even when i just following the tutorial online, or only online resource.
